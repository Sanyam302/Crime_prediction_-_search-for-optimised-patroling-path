# 🚨 Crime Prediction System

This is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of different types of crimes and whether an arrest might be made, based on location and time inputs. The project also includes a feature for **patrolling route optimization** based on crime predictions.

## 🔍 Features
- Predicts **crime type** and **arrest likelihood** based on location and time inputs
- **Patrolling route optimization** to suggest the best patrolling path based on crime data and predictions
- Built with machine learning models using **scikit-learn** for classification tasks
- Backend: **Node.js** (calling Python model via API)
- Frontend: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** (optional if used)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (ML model)
- **Node.js** (Backend)
- **scikit-learn**, **joblib**
- **VS Code**, **Git**, **GitHub**

## 📦 Status
This project is under development and will soon be deployed online.

## 🔗 How to Run
